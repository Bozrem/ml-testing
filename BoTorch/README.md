# BoTorch
BoTorch is my own ML library as a way for me to gain a deeper understanding of how it works, rather than slapping on some PyTorch to a project and having no idea what's happening. Yes, it will probably be way less efficient, and yes, it will likely yield worse results, but it's mine and I like it thank you very much.

The main idea is that I want it to be easily modularized, both able to handle doing tricky things or letting the library piece a lot of it together. This allows for it to be extrememly approachable to people wanting to get into ML, and have a better introduction to how it works.
